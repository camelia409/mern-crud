# MERN CRUD Application

This is a simple MERN stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with user authentication. The frontend is built with React, featuring a clean and responsive design, while the backend uses Node.js and Express to handle API requests. The app supports full CRUD operations on user data with secure login functionality.

The project is designed for beginners to learn the fundamentals of full-stack development without using external CSS frameworks. It demonstrates React hooks, RESTful API integration, and JWT-based authentication in a straightforward manner.
